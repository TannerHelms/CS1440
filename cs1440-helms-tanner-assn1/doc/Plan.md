# 0.  From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions

The problem that we are going to address is recreating some basic commands on our own
the basic commands are as follows...
    * Concatenate
    * CutPaste
    * Grep
    * Partial
    * Sorting
    * WordCount
We will be taking user input for the tool that we are going to use, some arguments for the tool,
and the files that we are going to use  


# 1.  System Analysis

Flow of the program
 1. The user gives command line arguments for the tool, some args for the tool, and the
    files that we are going to use. 
 2. Check to make sure the user inputted enough arguments
 3. Attempt to open the files, checking that they are valid
 4. Run the tool and output the results


# 2.  Functional Examples

Ask the user for the file. If we are not able to access the file then exit the program


# 3.  Function Template

Begin writing code from the architecture from step 1. If we get stuck or confused review
steps 0 and 1 or possibly edit them until we have a clear understanding of how
we are going to solve the problem


# 5.  Testing

Run the test cases against the code to verify that the outcome of the program
is the outcome that we are expecting. Attempt throwing some edge cases at your
program to guarantee that it is going to work
